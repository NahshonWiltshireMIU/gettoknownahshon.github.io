        <description>&lt;img src="https://github.com/NahshonWiltshireMIU/gettoknownahshon.github.io/post/professional-life/images.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Professional Life" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to get to know me a little better, here are some of the projects and activities pertaining to my professional life and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;programming-and-application-development&#34;&gt;Programming and Application Development
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text to Speech natural reader&lt;/strong&gt; - This idea came about after the release of &amp;ldquo;Kokoro&amp;rdquo;, a text to speech language model which is quite fascinating to see a model of just 82 million parameters able to create such crisp and clear audio. At the end of this project I wish to modify the os context menu using a registry change where the user can highlight some text and right click to open the context menu where the text could be read to the user in a natural language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss Event Risk Register&lt;/strong&gt; - This project is still in progress, but the general idea is a solution to monitor various risks and near misses in a business setting. The expectation is that reports can be quickly generated for executive summaries or audits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-is-a-sample-of-kokoro-tts-text-to-speech&#34;&gt;Here is a sample of Kokoro TTS (Text to Speech)

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My interest in computers and technology began at a very early stage in my life. I would have begun tinkering with a variety of devices, including FM radios, cell phones and computer desktops. Of course at times I would often worsen the issue before actually getting it resolved. Later in life I was introduced to the microsoft suite and in particular microsoft excel and the various formulas enhanced with the drag and drop capabilities which would copy the formula and update referenced fields based on pattens observed. Working with excel led me to realize that work can be lessened by using general instructions. In secondary school, I was introduced to a scripting language called pascal, it was then I truly saw the concept behind programming. I would have now known that at the end of the day, software is basically bundling code for solving a particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have went on to college to pursue a degree in Computer Science at the Dominica State College, there I learnt object oriented programming, networking, database management and web design. From then on, my vision was clear I worked towards becoming better in the field of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
